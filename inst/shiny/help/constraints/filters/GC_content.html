<h3 class="help">GC content</h3>
<div class="help">
<p>
The GC content is the ratio of guanines and cytosines among all nucleotides of a primer. The GC content is typically restricted to lie between 40% and 60%. GC-pairings are electrostatically more favorable than the pairings of other nucleotides, because guanine-cytosine interactions are based on three hydrogen bonds rather than two. Hence, the ratio of GCs is linked to the stability of the DNA-DNA duplex formed between primers and templates. Primers with balanced GC contents ensure balanced binding stabilities in the form of similar melting temperatures.

<p>Primers with high GC contents have high melting temperatures, which may yield less product. Primers with low GC contents, have low melting temperatures and might effect unspecific binding.
