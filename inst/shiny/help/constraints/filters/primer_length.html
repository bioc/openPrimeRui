<h3 class="help">Primer length</h3>
<div class="help">
<p>
Primer length is given by the number of nucleotides that make up the primer. The length of a primer should be chosen under consideration of uniqueness, hybridization stability, and cost minimization. While primers that are too short may be too unspecific, longer primers are associated with greater costs due to the larger number of nucleotides. Typical primers have lengths of circa 18-22 nucleotides.
