<div class = "help">
<p>Using the <i>Constraints</i> section of the <i>Settings</i> tab, you can select the 
physicochemical properties that are considered in your analysis.
Using the <i>Setting</i> column, you can specify the desired range of values
for a constraint. Primers whose properties lie in the specified range are considered to pass the constraint, while primers outside the range are considered to fail the constraint. When filtering a primer set, primers failing any of the active constraints are removed from the set.</p>
<p>The <i>Limit</i> column specifies the boundary for relaxing constraints when designing primers. If no solution achieving the desired target coverage can be found, the difference between the <i>Setting</i> and <i>Limit</i> column defines the relaxation step size.</p>
<p>For more information on individual constraints, please select one of the constraints that are listed in the navigation panel at the top of the page.</p>
