<h3 class="help">Cross dimerization</h3>
<div class="help">
<p>
Two primers are considered to dimerize when there exists a conformation of the two primers whose free energy is below the binding free energy cutoff. It is crucial that dimerizing primers are avoided as the presence of dimers can prevent binding of the primers to the templates, thereby reducing product yields.

<p>Note that the computation of dimers can be computationally demanding when using integer linear programs for designing primers.
