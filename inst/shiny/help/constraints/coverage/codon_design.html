<p>
Using our codon design options, you can modify the coverage definition such that possible coverage events leading to stop codons or other substitutions in the amplicon amino acid are discarded. When designing primers these options will automatically select for a primer set whose primers do not effect mismatches leading to changes in the amino acid sequence.
