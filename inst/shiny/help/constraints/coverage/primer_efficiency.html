Primer efficiency gives a value in the range [0,1] representing the 
efficiency at which a primer amplifies a template sequence during PCR.
To determine primer efficiency, we use the model from the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DECIPHER.html" target="_blank">DECIPHER</a> package, which considers the free energy of annealing, secondary structures, as well as a model for 3' mismatches in case of Taq polymerase.
