<p>
The PCR settings should correspond to the laboratory PCR conditions.
The setting for the annealing temperature can either be determined automatically for every primer individually according to its melting temperature or a single annealing temperature can be specified for all primers.</p>
<p>Several buffer ion concentrations (Na, Mg, K) can be adjusted directly. Note that the Tris 
buffer concentration is entered directly and halved to determine the concentration of the corresponding ions. Additionally, the concentrations of primers
and templates can be specified.
