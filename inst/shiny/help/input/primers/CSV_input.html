<h3 class="help">Input of primers as a CSV file</h3>
<div class="help">
<p>
Using the <i>Download</i> tab, it is possible to store all data pertaining to an evaluated set of primers as a CSV file. Such a downloaded primer CSV file (in <i>raw</i> format) can be used as an input to the tool. Once a primer CSV file is loaded, all of the previously computed properties of the primer set are loaded.</p>
This feature allows you to investigate a previously evaluated primer set at a later point in time. By providing multiple primer CSV files it is also possible to compare the properties of several primer sets.
