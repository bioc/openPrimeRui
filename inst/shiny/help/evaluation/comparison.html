<h3 class="help">Comparison of primer sets</h3>
<div class="help">
<p>
Multiple sets of primers can be compared with each other by uploading previous analysis results downloaded from openPrimeR. The files for the analysis should contain the coverage of the primers and therefore should be downloaded from openPrimeR in <i>raw</i> CSV format after the properties of the primers have been computed. If all primer sets relate to the same set of template sequences, only one template CSV file needs to be uploaded. Otherwise, each primer CSV file should have a corresponding template file.</p>
<p>
In order to match pairs of primers and templates, primer and template files should be uploaded in the same order. Either multiple files are uploaded in one operation, or, multiple uploads are performed in succession. All successive uploads are added to the current analysis set and the analysis set is only emptied, when the <i>Reset</i> button is used. After all files have been uploaded, the comparison can be commenced by selecting the active sets in the comparison table and clicking on the comparison button <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-scale"></i>.
</p>
<p>Using the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter"></i> button, loaded primer sets can be filtered according to the current constraints.</p>
