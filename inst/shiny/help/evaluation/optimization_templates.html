<div class="help">
<p>
Template binding regions can be optimized with regard to conservation or secondary structures. The selection of conserved binding region can reduce the runtime of the algorithm particularly for large target binding regions.</p>
<p>
Selecting template regions that do not form secondary structures can be beneficial because such structures may prevent primers from binding.
